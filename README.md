# 📈 StockTracking: Real-Time Market Data App

A lightweight stock-tracking web application that allows users to look up real-time market data, compare prices visually, and save a personalized watchlist. Built to strengthen my full-stack development skills, working across both **Flask APIs** and a **modern, responsive JavaScript UI**.

## ⭐ Highlights
- Fetches **live stock prices** using the Alpha Vantage API
- **Beautiful, responsive UI** built with Bootstrap and Chart.js
- **Interactive price comparison chart** for watchlisted stocks
- Local watchlist persistence using browser storage
- Robust error-handling for invalid symbols and API rate limits
- **Dark mode** for a more user-friendly experience

## 🧰 Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Full-stack web development**
  - Python Flask backend — API routing & JSON response handling
  - Modern JavaScript — DOM manipulation, async/await, fetch API
- **External API integration** with real-time response validation
- **State management** using localStorage for persistent watchlists
- **Data visualization** using Chart.js
- **Production-style UI/UX patterns** (loading states, validation, alerts)

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This app was built as part of my personal portfolio focused on:
- Improving my practical API experience in a realistic setting
- Designing user-friendly dashboards with real-time data
- Building applications that blend **software + data insights**

I’m continuing to evolve it as I grow in data engineering and product-oriented development.
